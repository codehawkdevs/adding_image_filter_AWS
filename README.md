# Image Filtering Microservice

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.


## Project Overview

This Image Filtering Microservice is deployed on AWS. This project demonstrates my understanding of non-monolith architecture or loosely coupled system design. This project is a part of an Instagram Clone where this microservice is being used so that when a microservice needs more resources then we can make that service more scaleable.
